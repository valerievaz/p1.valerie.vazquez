    <h1> Find the issues with the current design. </h1>
<p> Some issues with this design are the way the floors ascend, it can get confusing because they go in a zig-zag motion which is odd to me 
usually they go up. Another issue is that there is an emergency button on top of all of the buttons which can be hard to reach for someone in a wheelchair 
or a smaller person to reach in an emergency and the button on the top is also around a bunch of other keyholes which makes it hard to miss.
The bottom two buttons of the open and close door do not work, and they do not light up which could be an issue with the electrical of the elevator.  </p>
