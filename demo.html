<h1>Project One</h1>
    
    <h2> Explain why it is good/bad. </h2>
    <ul>
  <li>Accessibility buttons on botton for people in a wheelchair or special needs.</li>
  <li>Explaination of what each floors purpose is</li>
  <li>One emergency button is on top of all the floors which can be hard to reach for some</li>
  <li>Too many keyhole or deisgns near the button at the top, can be confusing or hard to miss</li>
  <li>Floor increase in a zig-zag order</li>
</ul>
    
    <h3> How does the elevator support the user to figure out how to make it work?</h3>
    <ul>
  <li>The buttons light up when you press one</li>
  <li>Theres a paper to describe the purpose of each floor</li> 
 </ul>
  
    <h4> Suggest the improvements to make on the control interface. Sketch your solution. And justify your design decisions.</h4>
    <ul>
  <li>I kept the buttons to light up when pressed to show something's been done</li>
  <li>I made the floors go up by column like most elevators do</li> 
  <li>The emergency buttons are at the bottom for people in wheelchairs who maybe can't reach the top or any other needs</li>
 </ul>
