## C Questions ##


- Find the issues with the current design.

Some issues with this design are the way the floors ascend, it can get confusing because they go in a zig-zag motion which is odd to me usually they go up. Another issue is that there is an emergency button on top of all of the buttons which can be hard to reach for someone in a wheelchair or a smaller person to reach in an emergency and the button on the top is also around a bunch of other keyholes which makes it hard to miss. The bottom two buttons of the open and close door do not work, and they do not light up which could be an issue with the electrical of the elevator. 
 
- Explain why it is good/bad.

The design is not the worst because there is braille accommodation for people with special needs. There is also a black label containing the specific floor to the button which is nice to further avoid confusion. There is also a paper on the side of the buttons explaining what each floor is which is useful for nonstudents who won't know what each floor is. The button also lights up when you press it. The emergency button is also on the bottom of the elevator buttons which I think is considerate to people in wheelchairs who can't necessarily reach the top of the buttons.

## B Questions ## 

- Think about the common things that you use in an elevator. List your most common uses and other rare uses. Does the interface make doing those common things easier?

I commonly use an elevator to go to higher floors in the library or apartment complexes. I think a rare use is to get to very low floors of whatever type of building since it’s not too common. I think the interface here makes it easy but I’ve seen some elevators have too much going on with buttons and weirdly named floors which gets very confusing. 
 
- Think about how the user interacts with the elevator. What is the common sequence of actions?

The common sequence of events is to get into the elevator and look around to see where the buttons are and what floor I need to get into and I wait for the doors to close and see if when I click a button if it makes a noise or lights up to see if it was actually clicked.

- How does the elevator support the user to figure out how to make it work?

The elevator in the library helps the user by providing a list of what each floor is or does since each floor has a purpose. As well as having the light up buttons. My elevator also has light up buttons but I did not make them different floors because I don’t think it’s necessary and just made them how normal elevators do it going from floor 1 to however many.
 
- How does the elevator provide feedback to the user?

 This is how the elevator should react to the user to make sure it’s responding to your requests. The feedback that the example and mine have in common is having a light go off when you press it which helps the user know that something did happen. 

- What are some common mistakes you can make with this current design?

With this current design, one can make the mistake of thinking the floors are in ascending order and not check the pattern it’s going in. Or click the wrong emergency button since one is too high up to tell that it’s there because there are also other things going on in that area.

- Suggest the improvements to make on the control interface. Sketch your solution. And justify your design decisions.

Some of the improvements to this design is not having too many things going on where the emergency buttons are. As well as making the buttons in ascending order and explaining the difference between the ground and first floor for international people. I kept my design as simple as possible because too many features make it hard to use or add confusion and by having minimal buttons/colors/designs it can be a simpler experience for the user.
