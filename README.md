# For a B

# Include the general information in your sketch: personalized calendar, news feed, text messages, social feed items, clock, and weather.
Here I implemented a weather API that was taught by Jake in class, I also implemented a clock using logic along with a digital time and date and a news API but I ran into the issue of not being to 
display it on the mirror itself where I wanted it so I guess it's basically on the botton cut of the "mirror".

# Include the health-related information in your sketch: sleep, weight, exercises, and mirror time.
Here I provided the Sleep app on the iphone and the step counter as well. 

# Extras 
I added a to do list function similar to the one on the iphone, and you can add to it like a list but I couldnt get the list to display on the mirror
so the elements would originally be added as an increment at the bottom of the mirror and i would have left it that way but for the sake of the prompt
I added the one element I could add to the screen on the screen.
