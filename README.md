## C Questions ##
- Find the issues with the current design.
Some issues with this design are the way the floors ascend, it can get confusing because they go in a zig-zag motion which is odd to me usually they go up. Another issue is that there is an emergency button on top of all of the buttons which can be hard to reach for someone in a wheelchair or a smaller person to reach in an emergency and the button on the top is also around a bunch of other keyholes which makes it hard to miss. The bottom two buttons of the open and close door do not work, and they do not light up which could be an issue with the electrical of the elevator. 
 
- Explain why it is good/bad.
The design is not the worst because there is braille accommodation for people with special needs. There is also a black label containing the specific floor to the button which is nice to further avoid confusion. There is also a paper on the side of the buttons explaining what each floor is which is useful for nonstudents who won't know what each floor is. The button also lights up when you press it. The emergency button is also on the bottom of the elevator buttons which I think is considerate to people in wheelchairs who can't necessarily reach the top of the buttons.
